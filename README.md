# coordinate-geometry-app
A simple app that can calculate perimeter of points on a 2-D coordinate system.

You can use this to simulate points on a 2-D plane by using an input file(input.txt) with the format:
x0 y0
x1 y1
x2 y2
.
.
.
xN yN

The logic works by connecting the points from x0 y0 to xN yN, from end-to-end.
